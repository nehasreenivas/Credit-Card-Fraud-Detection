# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Credit card fraud detection is a critical task in the financial industry. Its primary goal is to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions, ensuring that legitimate cardholders are not charged for unauthorized purchases.

# 1.Data Collection for Machine Learning:
Gather relevant data from various sources.
Ensure the data is representative of the problem you want to solve.
Data can be in different formats (CSV, databases, APIs, etc.).

# 2.Preprocessing and Preparing Your Data:
Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Perform feature engineering (creating new features, encoding categorical variables, scaling features).
Split the data into training and test sets.

# 3.Selecting the Right Machine Learning Model:
Choose an appropriate algorithm based on your problem type (classification, regression, clustering, etc.).
Consider factors like interpretability, scalability, and performance.

# 4.Training Your Machine Learning Model:
Feed the training data into the chosen model.
The model learns from the data and adjusts its internal parameters.
Iteratively improve the model by adjusting hyperparameters.

# 5.Evaluating Model Performance:
Use the test set to evaluate how well the model generalizes to unseen data.
Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC).

# 6.Tuning and Optimizing Your Model:
Fine-tune hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, regularization strength) to improve performance.
Use techniques like cross-validation to find the best settings.
